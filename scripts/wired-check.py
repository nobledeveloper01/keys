"""
Finds code that is written, tested, and called by nothing.

Run it with the other gates: `python3 scripts/wired-check.py`.

**Four times in one project.** `Tracker` — the capture loop, the thing the
whole product is built around — was complete and had seven tests, and nothing
ever called `start()`. `permissions.ts` was complete and had nine tests, and
nothing ever asked for a permission. `registerDevice` was written on the client
and proven over the wire by the round-trip, and nothing in the app registered a
device. Sealing a proof of delivery was written, tested and reachable from
nowhere — a driver finishing a delivery and not being paid. Every one of them
had a screen describing what it did.

None of the existing gates ask this question. The round-trip proves a client
method works against the server; the endpoint tests prove the server works;
`tsc` and `dotnet build` prove the types line up. An export nobody imports
type-checks perfectly, and so does a repository method nobody queries.

Four rules, all narrow enough to be worth failing a build over.

On the app:

1. A module under `src/native` or `src/state` whose exports are imported only
   by tests. These are the seams — the native modules and the hooks — and a
   seam nobody is on the other side of is a seam that does nothing.
2. A public method on `BackhaulApi` with no caller outside `api/client.ts`.
   Every one of them is a route somebody built on the server.

On the server, where the same defect hides better, because a repository method
with an endpoint test looks exactly like a repository method with a caller:

3. A public method on a repository class under
   `Backhaul.Infrastructure/Repositories` with no caller anywhere in
   `server/src` outside its own file. A repository method is only ever reached
   through a controller; if no controller reaches it, no request does.
   **Controller actions themselves are never reported** — they are the entry
   points, called over HTTP by a client this script cannot see.
4. A public method on a domain mirror under `Backhaul.Domain` with no caller
   outside its own file *and* no reference under `server/tests`. The mirrors
   exist to be held to `fixtures/parity.json` (ADR-0005), so a parity test
   referencing one is a legitimate reason for it to exist ahead of its caller —
   but a mirror with neither a caller nor a parity case is a second
   implementation of a rule that nothing compares against the first.

Two kinds of C# member are excluded from rules 3 and 4 because the language
calls them without anybody naming them: `override` members, and the small set
of interface and record contracts (`Equals`, `GetHashCode`, `ToString`,
`CompareTo`, `Deconstruct`, `Dispose`, `DisposeAsync`, `GetEnumerator`).
Reporting `ToString()` as unwired would teach people to ignore this gate.

All four are allowed the same escape hatch — `wired-check: <reason>` on the
line directly above the declaration — because a seam can legitimately land
before its caller. The reason is the point: it makes the gap a decision
somebody wrote down rather than a thing nobody noticed.
